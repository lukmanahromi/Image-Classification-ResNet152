# Image-Classification-ResNet152

An Image classification web app using ResNet-152. I'm using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) as Online IDE and [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) to save all my asset as a resource to complete the project.

## Pre-trained model is built by :
1. [Keras](https://keras.io/)
2. [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
3. [ResNet-152](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/resnet/ResNet152)

## Deploy tools :
1. [Flask Python](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
2. [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)

## How to Use

1. Recommend! using Google Colab to execute the program. 
2. Use ResNet_image_classification.ipynb for pre-trained model
3. Use Deploy_web.ipynb for deploying to a Web App using Flask Python
